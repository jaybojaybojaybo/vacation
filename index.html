        <h2>Singapore!</h2>
        <img src="img/singapore.jpb" alt="A photo of a rooftop pool in Singapore.">
        <p>Singapore has a past rich in history and cultural heritage, stemming from the pre-colonial relics of Temasek, a sea town and trading post, through the founding and settlement of Modern Singapore by the British, the World Wars, and independence. The island nation also stands at the crossroads of the different cultures of Asia, and is a gateway between the East and the West, resulting in a truly cosmopolitan society, a country of different pasts and histories. Find out how Singapore evolved over the years from a sleepy fishing village to the bustling metropolis it is today, and learn about the culture of the people, including the official (and unofficial) languages of Singapore.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>There isn’t anywhere else on Earth where people confluence - like the way they do in Singapore. From visitors and transients to citizens, this progressive island and gateway to South East Asia is a dynamic mix of cultures, ideas and histories neither ethnic nor exotic, instead, the essence of modern Asia - sparklingly savvy, with a touch of old school. The first-time visitor should expect to be surprised, confused, and, charmed.</p>

        <h2>Salvador de Bahia, Brazil!</h2>
        <p>Bahia is the soul of Brazil. In this northeastern state more than anywhere else, the country’s cultures and races have mixed, producing, many believe, what is most authentically Brazilian.</P>
        <p>With over 1000km of coconut-fringed beaches and the most agreeable climate in the region – hot and sunny, but not as blistering as elsewhere – Bahia has long been one of the country’s most popular destinations for foreign visitors. Constituting over a third of Northeast Brazil, it sits to the south of the area’s other states. At its heart are the Chapada Diamantina Mountains, offering breathtaking trekking and climbing opportunities, while just north of there, the massive São Francisco Lakes are popular for canoeing and watersports. The countryside changes to the south of the state capital, Salvador (site of the first Portuguese landings in 1500), with mangrove swamps and fast-developing island resorts around the town of Valença, before reverting to a spectacular coastline. </p>
        <img src="img/bahia.jpg" alt="A photo of a beach in Salvador da Bahia, Brazil.">
        <p>A string of colonial towns, including Santo Amaro and Cachoeira, also lie within striking distance of Salvador. Further south, Ilhéus is a thriving beach resort, as is Porto Seguro, whose early settlement pre-dates even Salvador’s. Beyond the coastline, Bahia comprises a vast grain-producing western sector and semi-arid landscape. The Bahian sertão is massive, a desert-like land that supports some fascinating towns – the ex-mining bases of Jacobina and Lençóis and the river terminus of Ibotirama are just three.</p>
        <p>The bay on which Salvador was built afforded its settlers a superb natural anchorage, while the surrounding lands of Bahia state were ideal country for sugar-cane and tobacco plantations. In the seventeeth century, Salvador became the centre of the Recôncavo, the richest plantation zone in Brazil before the arrival of coffee the following century. It was the national capital for over two centuries, before relinquishing the title to Rio in 1763.</p>
        <p>Carnaval reaches a frenzied peak in Salvador every February, when the city heaves with two million people enjoying traditional tunes, from the popular and loud Barra seaside suburb to the more arty Pelhourinho.</p>
